# The Idea

[This](https://x.com/RLCS_CarDesigns) twitter handle very regularly shares car designs of pro Rocket League players from either
- their Twitch/whatever streams
- S/A/B/C and so on tier events.

A lot of players (myself included) like to use these designs via a Client-side tool called **bakkesmod**. Using it is extremely easy, just copy the code and import. All items work.

### This project is an attempt to make it into a easy usable API/website so that its easy to browse, like, endorse and use designs. This opens up avenues of searching/sorting designs by Players, etc, eliminating the need for X.
